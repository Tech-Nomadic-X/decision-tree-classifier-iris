# 🌳 Decision Tree Implementation using Scikit-learn

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn. The model is trained on the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species based on features such as petal and sepal length and width.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Visualizations
- Pairplot to understand feature distribution
- Decision Tree plot to visualize model logic

## 📈 Model Performance
- Classifier trained using `entropy` criterion and depth-limited to 3
- Accuracy score and classification report generated
- High interpretability through tree visualization

## ✅ Results
The model performs well on the test set and provides interpretable visual splits of decision logic.
